# Portworx Common Questions

This document provides detailed answers to common questions about Portworx.

### -1. Explain the replication mechanism for volume replicas

Portworx uses synchronous replication to maintain data redundancy and ensure high availability. When a volume is created with a specified replication factor (e.g., 3 replicas), Portworx automatically replicates data across different nodes. Each write operation to the volume is mirrored to all replicas in real-time, ensuring data consistency across replicas. This mechanism allows data to remain accessible even if one or more nodes fail, as long as a majority of replicas are still available.

### -2. Is the replication synchronous?

Yes, the replication in Portworx is synchronous. This means that all replicas are updated at the same time with each write operation. When data is written to a volume, it is simultaneously replicated to the specified number of replicas. The write operation is only acknowledged as successful once all replicas confirm they have received the data. Synchronous replication ensures data consistency across replicas but may introduce slight latency based on network performance and distance between nodes.

### -3. How does the mechanism deal with whole zone failure? 

If you have a volume with three replicas distributed across three zones and one zone fails, the volume will still be available for reading and writing as long as a majority of the replicas are accessible (i.e., at least two out of three). In this scenario, Portworxâ€™s quorum mechanism allows the volume to stay online as long as more than half of the replicas are active. However, if a second zone were to fail, the volume would become unavailable since quorum would be lost.

### -4. When does the operator use NFS?

The Portworx operator generally uses NFS for shared volumes that need to be accessed concurrently by multiple nodes or applications. NFS is suitable for applications that require shared storage but do not need high-performance block storage. It is often used for workloads that are read-intensive or for sharing files among different application instances. Note that NFS volumes in Portworx may not provide the same level of performance or consistency as replicated block volumes.

### -5. What is the role of each pod in the operator?

In a typical Portworx deployment, several pods have specific roles to manage and maintain the storage cluster:

- **Portworx Pod**: This is the main storage pod that manages storage resources, handles data replication, and provides block and file storage services to applications.
- **Stork Pod**: Stork (Storage Orchestration Runtime for Kubernetes) assists with scheduling, disaster recovery, and migration of applications using Portworx. It helps to ensure high availability and data resilience.
- **KVDB Pod**: If using an internal KVDB, this pod provides a distributed key-value store to manage the state and metadata of the Portworx cluster. External KVDB configurations will rely on an external key-value store instead.
- **Portworx Operator Pod**: The operator pod automates the installation, updates, and management of Portworx components on the cluster.
  
Each pod plays a critical role in ensuring that Portworx runs reliably, supports storage orchestration, and maintains high availability.

### 6. Explanation of `storkctl` and `stork` usage in Portworx

**storkctl** is a command-line interface for managing Stork, the Portworx storage orchestrator. Stork integrates tightly with Kubernetes and provides advanced scheduling, disaster recovery, and migration capabilities for stateful applications.

**Usage**:
- **Volume Snapshots**: Storkctl allows users to create and manage snapshots of volumes, enabling point-in-time recovery and backups.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Stork facilitates application failover and replication across clusters, allowing you to set up backup policies and disaster recovery workflows.
- **Application Migration**: It supports migration of applications and their data from one Kubernetes cluster to another, useful for cloud migration and hybrid cloud setups.

Stork works as an extension to Kubernetes, enhancing the capabilities of Portworx to handle storage-specific requirements for containerized applications.

### 7. What is the recommended size for a KVDB dedicated disk?

The recommended size for a dedicated KVDB disk is depended on:
* If IOPS are independent of disk size, the **minimum recommended size is 32 GB and a minimum of 450 IOPs**.
* If IOPS are dependent on disk size, the **recommended size is 150 GB to ensure you get a minimum of 450 IOPs**.
